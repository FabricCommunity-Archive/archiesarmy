# Minecraft Parity Project - Archie's Army

A Minecraft Mod developed to bring parity between the existing Minecraft games, both in terms of technical systems and content.

## Technical Content
- Loading, rendering and processing of Bedrock Entity Models through Resource Data(minecraft:geometry).
- Loading, applying, playing and overlaying Bedrock Entity Model Animations through Resource Data. Still WIP.
- An abstract Spell system for Illagers to easily add different functionality and spells to their AI.
- Mob Enchantment. Additional mob flag which, when given to a mob, increases speed, damage/effectiveness, health, defense and adds a more menacing appearance.

## Game Content
The game content added from other Minecraft games.

### Minecraft Dungeons
Content from Mojang Studios' recent Dungeon Crawler.
#### Entities
- The Enchanter
  - An Illager who prefers their tomes over the Vindicator's axe. They use their enchantment prowess to enhance hostile mobs and send them towards their target.
  - Can enchant up to 3 entities at once. Zombies, Creepers, and Skeletons.
  - Flees from the player, but is able to fight back with a hearty slap of their book when cornered.
- The Redstone Monstrosity (WIP)
  - A towering construct once created by the Arch Illager to destroy any and all resistance in one quick action. Its flaming hot attacks melt, and sometimes even animate, stone. It is now long abandoned, who knows where it rests?
  - A Boss Mob spawning in a specific area of the Nether, guarding a shard of the Orb of Dominance.
  - Can attack physically, causing shockwaves that knock back and damage the player, spew molten stone and summon minions.
  
#### World Generation
- The Fiery Forge (WIP)
  - The home of the Redstone Monstrosity. A massive abandoned complex filled with forges, smelteries, broken machinery and insidious traps. Supposedly also the resting place of a piece of the Orb of Dominance.
  - Randomly generated structure, themed around metalwork. Spawns in the Nether. Houses the Redstone Monstrosity as boss, which rewards a OOD Shard.
  
#### Miscellanious
- The Orb of Dominance
  - A ancient relict, said to grant its users untold powers. Though shattered, the Arch Illager once wielded it. Perhaps it's possible to unlock it's powers by assembling it once again...?
