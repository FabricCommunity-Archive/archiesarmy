# Minecraft Parity Project - Archie's Army

A Minecraft Mod developed to bring parity between the existing Minecraft games, both in terms of technical systems and content.

## Technical Content
- Loading, rendering and processing of Bedrock Entity Models through Resource Data(minecraft:geometry).
- Loading, applying, playing and overlaying Bedrock Entity Model Animations through Resource Data. Still WIP.
- A abstract Spell system for Illagers to easily add different functionality and spells to their AI.
- Mob Enchantment. Additional mob flag which, when given to a mob, increases speed, damage/effectiveness, health, defense and adds a more menacing appearance.

## Game Content
The game content added from other Minecraft games.

### Minecraft Dungeons
Content from Mojang's recent Dungeon Crawler.
#### Entities
- The Enchanter Illager
  - A Illager that prefers his tomes over the Vindicator's axe. He uses his enchantment prowess to enchant and enhance hostile mobs and sent them towards their target.
  - Can enchant Skeletons, Creepers and Zombies.
  - Flees from the player, but is able to fight back with a hearty slap of his book.
- The Redstone Monstrosity (WIP)
  - A towering construct created by the Arch Illager to destroy any and all resistance in one quick action. It's flaming hot attacks melt and sometimes animated even stone.
  - A Boss Mob spawning in a specific area of the Nether, guarding a shard of the Orb of Dominance.
  - Can attack physicially, cause shockwaves so knockback and damage the player, spew molten stone and summon minions.
  
#### World Generation
- The Fiery Forge (WIP)
  - The home of the Redstone Monstrosity. A massive abandoned complex filled with forgers, smelteries, broken machinery and insidious traps. Supposedly the resting place of a piece of the Orb of Dominance as well.
  - Randomly generated structure, themed around metalwork. Spawns in the Nether. Houses the Redstone Monstrosity as boss, which rewards a OOD Shard.
  
#### Miscellanious
- The Orb of Dominance
  - A ancient relict, said to grant its users untold powers. Though shattered, the Arch Illager once wielded it. Perhaps it's possible to unlock it's powers by assembling it once again...?
